This directory contains scripts for performing k-fold cross-validation in the binding free energy prediction project.
### Purpose
K-fold cross-validation is used to assess the generalizability and robustness of the machine learning models for binding free energy and entropy predictions. 
By training and validating on different data splits, this approach provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.
